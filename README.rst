.. note: This is a work in progress and part of this project will likely change
    and could potentially break things. Be careful with using it.

Fancypages provides easy inline page editing. 

Another content management system, you ask? No it is not! Rather, it is a *content
enhancement system* (CEnS) because it provides a user with the controlled
ability to edit content on a page.

The way this Django app works is inspired by `django-frontend-admin`_,
`django-content-blocks`_ and other similar apps. Especially, the use of
template tags to define customisable sections in a Django template is
based on the ideas in the two apps mentioned above.

Installation
------------

To use ``django-fancypages`` in your own project follow these steps:

1. Install via pip into you virtualenv (for now you have to install from
   the github repo because we haven't released it to PyPI yet)::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-fancypages.git

2. Add the required apps to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` by simply using the
   convenience function ``get_apps`` in the ``fancypages`` module::

    from fancyages import get_required_apps, get_fancypages_apps

    YOUR_OTHER_APPS = [
        ...
    ]
    INSTALLED_APPS = YOUR_OTHER_APPS + get_required_apps() + get_fancypages_apps()

3. Add the editor middleware that provides the editing panel to every
   fancypage or page that contains an FP container::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        ...
        'fancypages.middleware.EditorMiddleware',
    )

4. Add the urls for ``django-fancypages`` to your project's main
   ``urls.py``. Make sure that it is at the end of you definitions
   otherwise the it will prevent your other URLs from working because it
   defines a rather generic URL pattern for its pages::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^', include(fancypages.urls)),
    )

5. Fancypages requires several default settings to be added. To make sure
   that you have all the default settings in your settings, you can use
   the defaults provided by fancypages itself. Add the following in your
   settings file **before** you overwrite specific settings::

    ...

    from fancypages.defaults import *

    ...

CSS
~~~

The CSS used by fancypages is generated by less using
``django-compressor``. This means you have to have ``lessc`` installed on your
system or in your virtualenv. You can either take care of that yourself or
use the ``requirements_less.txt`` file with ``pip`` to install both into your
virtualenv::

    $ pip install -r requirements_less.txt

That's been a bit of work, hasn't it? Well done! Your should now be able to
access the fancypages dashboard after staring the Django server by running
``./manage.py runserver`` or whatever else you do for that. A very basic
dashboard should now be available at: http://localhost:8000/dashboard/fancypages
